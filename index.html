                "Education is not just knowledge of text books; education is not just about getting a job, it is about leading a meaningful and happy life. While it is imperative to impart all job oriented skills in our students it is also necessary to teach him how to think instead of only what to think ( Pre-decided syllabus and world view ).

<b style="color: #080b2a;">CHAIRMAN'S COMMUNIQUE —</b>
Today education is synonymous with examination, employment and empowerment; we believe it should also stand for emancipation, ennoblement and evolution. It should not be only with stuffing of facts in students mind but help them in actualizing their potential. VITS believes in raising level of all students on a continuous basis. They are made to compete with themselves. They are encouraged to think, to innovate and shoulder responsibility for their actions. We want to make them proactive individuals who are constantly and relentlessly adding value to their environment."
